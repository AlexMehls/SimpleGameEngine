switch to GameEngine (more)
gameEngine settings (v-sync, ...)

performance issues with v-sync (? could just be setting the aspect ratio every frame)
better rendering (direct access to RenderObjects)
proper game loop (fixed/variable)
timings not with doubles (int64 instead)
more complex Transform variable access

recursive object destruction?

fix global values in transform -> rotation /scale should affect position of child objects

better component construction architecture

fix rotation (moving camera in circles shouldn't cause rolling) + roll should be visible -> rotation with locked axis?

assimp as shared lib? / static lib? / fetch content?
cleanup rendering
migrate? renderObjects

support more file types
cleanup mehs + texture
color only textures
skybox / background color


COMPONENTS NEED TO BE CREATED WITH NEW
