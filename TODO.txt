switch to GameEngine (more)

performance issues with v-sync (? could just be setting the aspect ratio every frame)
proper game loop (fixed/variable)
timings not with doubles (int64 instead)
more complex Transform variable access

integrate RenderObject and Camera into new GameObject system
Transform.parent setter method? -> remove friend classes
recursive object destruction?

transform -> scale should affect position

switch to game coordinates? swap y and z
add rendering to engine
better component construction architecture
adjust transform when changing parent

fix rotation (moving camera in circles shouldn't cause rolling) + roll should be visible
